This makes sense because in most March madness games I'm sure the point difference is relatively small. This data also helps visualize the high-stake games that have a lot of points of the line. Judging from the data, the biggest wins and losses occur on Thursday, followed by Friday and Saturday. Wednesday appears to typically has the lowest- stake games, followed closely by Tuesday and Monday. "

The difference between the 1985 data and the 2017 data is more than 1000 points, which causes us to assume that the skill level of the March madness athletes has increased as well. Those who win March madness are scoring more points, and that trend might continue to increase. "

However, in 2017 at the end of the data recorded, the total amount of winning points reached 5,322- more than 1,000 more points than the data started with. Aside from the first few seasons, the winning points remained relatively consistant with each other.

This visual comparison allows us to understand which day of the week corresponds to the highest amount of points in games. As seen on the chart, Wednesday has the lowest amount of points whereas Thursday has the highest. Friday falls into a close second place, but then Saturday and Sunday are both drastically less. Monday and Tuesday have even more drastically less points than games on Sunday did. This data is very interesting because it allows us to understand which days of the week the higher scoring games fall on. Similar to how students may not perform as well at the beginning of the week due to exhaustion, athletes during March madness appear to reflect the same trend as well. However, these drastic differences could also be a result of less games falling on the days at the beginning of the week. "
